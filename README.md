Hello! If you see this, then you have come across the repository holding our Weather Radar Theory and Practice Final Project code! 
We would have uploaded the NEXRAD Level II files utilized in the final report of our project, but Github would not allow files over 25 MB to be uploaded.
Don't worry! You can still check out this code for yourself by going to the NEXRAD AWS S3 Bucket site to choose any radar data from any time or place and the code will work just fine!
